TYPE NEEDS TO BE CHECKED, THEY ARE TYPES NOT VARIABLES!!!!!!

%prec NAME -> define it in association


NEEDS TO BE CHECKED:


Alle regler i grammatikken der leder til et "statement" kræver et nyt scope

symbol struct contains void pointer "value" in case we want to expand our types to extend other than integers

strings are not a native part of tiger (sheer khan).
